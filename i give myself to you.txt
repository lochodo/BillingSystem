I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

Here I am
Here I am

Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands

Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me
I give myself away

I give myself away (I want to be use by you)
So You can use me

I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me

Take my heart
Take my life

As a living sacrifice
All my dreams all my plans

Lord I place them in your hands

My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to you

I’ll never be more Loved
Than I am Right now
Wasn’t Holding you up
So there’s nothing I can do
To Let you down
Doesn’t take a Trophy
To make you Proud
I’ll never be more Loved
Than I am Right now

Going Through a Storm
But I won’t go down
I Hear your Voice
Carried in the Rhythm
Of the Wind to Call me out
You would Cross an Ocean
So I wouldn’t Drown
You’ve never been Closer
Than you are Right now

Jireh, You are Enough
Jireh, You are Enough
I will be Content In every Circumstance
Jireh, You are Enough

Forever Enough, always Enough
More than Enough
Forever Enough, always Enough
More than Enough

I don’t wanna Forget
How I feel right now
On the Mountain Top
I can see so Clear what it’s all about
Stay by my Side
When the Sun goes down
I don’t wanna Forget
How I Feel Right now

I’m Already Loved,
I’m Already Chosen
I know who I am
I know what you’ve Spoken
I’m Already Loved,
More than I could Imagine
And that is Enough

That is Enough, that is Enough
That is Enough, that is Enough
And that is Enough
That is Enough, that is Enough
That is Enough, that is Enough

You are Enough, You are Enough
You are Enough, You are Enough
You are Enough, You are Enough
You are Enough, You are Enough

You are Enough
So I am Enough
You are Enough
So I am Enough 

If he Dresses the Lilies
With Beauty and Splendor
How much more will he Clothe you
How much more
Will he Clothe you
If he watches over every Sparrow
How much more does he Love you
How much more
Does he Love you 

How much more
Does he Love you
How much more
Does he Love you

How much more
Does he Love you
How much more
Does he Love you
How much more
Does he Love you

 More than you ask
Think or Imagine
According to his Power working in us
It’s more than Enough 

It’s more than Enough
How much more does he Love you
It’s more than Enough
How much more does he Love you
More than Enough
More than Enough


Jireh, You are Enough
Jireh, You are Enough
I will be Content In every Circumstance
Jireh, You are Enough
I will be Content In every Circumstance
Jireh, You are Enough
